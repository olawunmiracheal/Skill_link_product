# Skill Link – Connecting You to Verified Artisans Nearby

## 🧩 What My Product Does

**Skill Link** is a **mobile-first platform** that connects users directly with **verified artisans**, including plumbers, electricians, carpenters, painters, and other skilled professionals in their area.

It simplifies the process of finding reliable home service providers by allowing users to **search, view profiles, chat, book, and pay** — all in one secure place.

Both artisans and clients are verified to build **mutual trust**, while payments are held in **escrow** until the job is confirmed completed.

## 💡 Why It Matters

In Nigeria (and many developing markets), finding trustworthy artisans is a major challenge.  
People rely on word-of-mouth referrals or social media posts, often leading to:

- ❌ Scams or no-shows  
- ⚒️ Unprofessional work  
- 🏠 Safety concerns when strangers enter their homes  

At the same time, many skilled artisans struggle to find consistent work or showcase their skills to serious clients.

**Skill Link** solves this by creating a **transparent, trusted, and digital marketplace** that bridges the gap — helping users get quality service while artisans grow their reputation and income safely.
